This helps handle small merges faster, rather than filling the pool with lengthy merges.
                                  Number of free entries in pool to lower max size of merge: Threshold value of free entries in the pool. If the number of entries in the pool falls below this value, ClickHouse reduces the maximum size of a data part to merge. This helps handle small merges faster, rather than filling the pool with lengthy merges.
