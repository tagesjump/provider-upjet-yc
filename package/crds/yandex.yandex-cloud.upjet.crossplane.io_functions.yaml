                  required on creation, but we do not desire to update them after creation,
                  for example because of an external controller is managing them, like an
                  autoscaler.

                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future

                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.
